# `angular-seed-gulp-browserify`

A seed for AngularJS apps using Gulp to build and Browserify to bundle.
 
This project will eventually be an application skeleton for an AngularJS web 
app that uses Gulp as the build system and Browserify to bundle, and Babelify 
to transpile ES6 to ES5.

The seed will contain a sample AngularJS application, and makes available 
various tasks enabling building and testing.

## Project structure

This is taken from https://github.com/toddmotto/angular-styleguide and is 
different to https://github.com/angular/angular-seed, because it is designed 
to be support an Angular2 upgrade.  As such, the structure is closer to 
https://github.com/angular/angular2-seed.
