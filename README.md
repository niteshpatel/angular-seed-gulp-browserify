# `angular-seed-gulp-browserify`

A seed for AngularJS apps using Gulp to build and Browserify to bundle.
 
This project will eventually be an application skeleton for an AngularJS web app that uses Gulp as the build system and 
Browserify to bundle, and Babelify to transpile ES6 to ES5.

The seed will contain a sample AngularJS application, and makes available various tasks enabling building and testing.
